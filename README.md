# CorruptCrimsonMimic
This plugin modifies the behavior of Mimics spawned using a Key of Night. Instead of always spawning a Mimic based on the world's biome (Crimson or Corruption), this plugin introduces a 50/50 random chance to spawn either a Corrupt Mimic or a Crimson Mimic â€” regardless of the worldâ€™s alignment.

ðŸ”§ Features
Intercepts natural and player-triggered Big Mimic spawns (via Key of Night).

Randomly replaces the spawned Mimic with either the Corrupt or Crimson version.

Ensures a more varied and challenging experience for players farming Mimics in single-biome worlds.

ðŸ“¦ Installation
Build the plugin and place the .dll in your TShock ServerPlugins folder.

Restart your TShock server.

ðŸ§  Use Case
Ideal for worlds with only one evil biome, giving players access to both types of biome-specific loot without needing to generate a second world.
