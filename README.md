# CorruptCrimsonMimic
This plugin modifies the behavior of Mimics spawned using a Key of Night. Instead of always spawning a Mimic based on the world's biome (Crimson or Corruption), this plugin introduces a 50/50 random chance to spawn either a Corrupt Mimic or a Crimson Mimic, regardless of the worldâ€™s alignment.
